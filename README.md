## What are magic numbers?
Magic numbers are the first few bytes of a file which are unique to a particular file type. These unique bits are referred to as magic numbers,  also sometimes referred to as a  file signature.

## How to use this script?

#### Step 1
Copy the python script into the same folder where your unknown file is stored. <br />
Now run the terminal or command prompt and type: <br />
```python hexer.py``` <br /> <br />
